# Custom Voice Setup Guide

## Option 1: Voice Cloning Services (Recommended)

### Best Services:
1. **ElevenLabs** (www.elevenlabs.io)
   - High quality, natural-sounding clones
   - Easy API integration
   - ~$5-22/month depending on characters

2. **Murf.ai** (murf.ai)
   - Professional quality
   - Multiple voice styles
   - ~$29/month

3. **Play.ht** (play.ht)
   - Voice cloning + TTS API
   - Good for production apps
   - ~$25-99/month

### How It Works:
1. Record 3-5 minutes of sample audio
2. Upload to the cloning service
3. Get API access
4. Generate speech from text
5. Stream audio files to your app

## Option 2: iOS Native Voices

iOS has built-in voices you can use. To preview them:

1. Open **Settings** on your iPhone
2. Go to **Accessibility** > **Spoken Content** > **Voices**
3. Download different voices to hear them
4. Note the voice names (e.g., "Samantha", "Karen", "Daniel")

Then we can specify which voice to use in code.

## Option 3: Custom Cloud TTS

Services like Google Cloud TTS or Amazon Polly allow you to:
- Use pre-made professional voices
- Customize pitch, speed, emphasis
- Integrate via API

## What I Recommend:

**For a nutrition AI app, I'd suggest:**

1. **ElevenLabs** - Upload a sample of the voice you want, clone it, then integrate their API
2. Or use iOS's "Karen" voice - it's already warm and friendly

Would you like me to:
- A) Help you integrate a voice cloning service (ElevenLabs/Play.ht)?
- B) Show you how to preview and select from iOS voices?
- C) Set up a custom voice using cloud TTS?
